## Monolithic Architecture: A Comprehensive Overview

** Simple and Cheap (implementation, cost to operate)**
![Monolithic Architecture diagram](monolithic.svg)

A monolithic architecture is a software design pattern in which all of the components of an application are tightly coupled and packaged into a ***single codebase and deployment unit***. This includes the user interface, application logic, and data access layer.

Monolithic architectures are often the ***simplest*** to design and develop, as they do not require complex coordination between different components. However, they can become increasingly difficult to maintain and scale as the application grows in size and complexity.

## Components of a Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture typically consists of the following components:

    Presentation layer: The presentation layer is responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with users.
    Application layer: The application layer contains the core business logic of the application. It is responsible for processing user requests and generating responses.
    Data access layer: The data access layer interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.

## How Monolithic Architecture Works

When a user requests a page or performs an action in the application, the presentation layer sends a request to the application layer. The application layer then processes the request, updates the database as needed, and generates a response. The response is then sent back to the presentation layer, which renders it for the user.

## Implementation API Gateway

**Clients: Web, Mobile, Desktop**

Web, mobile, and desktop clients are the applications that users interact with. These clients use APIs to interact with the monolithic system.

**APIs**

APIs are interfaces that allow different components of a software system to communicate with each other. In a monolithic architecture, APIs are used to expose the functionality of the monolithic system to clients.

**Thirdparty**

Thirdparty systems are external systems that need to interact with the monolithic system. These systems can use a system gateway to interact with the monolithic system.

**System Gateway**

A system gateway is a layer that sits between the monolithic system and thirdparty systems. The system gateway provides a single point of entry for thirdparty systems to access the monolithic system. The system gateway can also be used to enforce security and authentication policies.

**SDK**

An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools and libraries that developers can use to build applications. SDKs are often provided by software companies to help developers build applications that interact with their products. In a monolithic architecture, SDKs can be provided to clients and thirdparty systems to help them interact with the monolithic system.

**REST API**

A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that uses the HTTP protocol to communicate. REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request is independent of any previous requests. REST APIs are also cacheable, meaning that clients can cache responses to improve performance.

**RPC**

RPC is a protocol that allows a program to call a procedure on a remote computer as if it were a local procedure. This is done by sending a request message to the remote computer, which executes the procedure and returns the results to the client program.

RPC is typically implemented using a client-server model. The client program is the program that makes the RPC call, and the server program is the program that executes the procedure and returns the results.
RPC protocols

There are a number of different RPC protocols that can be used, including:

    XML-RPC: XML-RPC is a simple RPC protocol that is based on XML. It is widely used for web services and other lightweight applications.
    JSON-RPC: JSON-RPC is a similar RPC protocol that is based on JSON. It is often used for mobile applications and other applications where bandwidth is limited.
    gRPC: gRPC is a high-performance RPC protocol that is based on Protocol Buffer. It is often used for microservices architectures and other applications where performance is critical.

**REST API vs RPC**

REST APIs and RPC APIs are two different types of APIs. REST APIs are stateless and cacheable, while RPC APIs are stateful and not cacheable. REST APIs are also more flexible and extensible than RPC APIs.

In general, REST APIs are a better choice for most applications. However, RPC APIs may be a better choice for applications that require high performance or real-time communication.

## Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

    Simplicity: Monolithic architectures are relatively simple to design and develop. This is because all of the components of the application are tightly coupled and packaged together.
    Efficiency: Monolithic architectures can be efficient for small and medium-sized applications. This is because all of the components of the application are co-located on the same server, which reduces latency and improves performance.
    Ease of maintenance: Monolithic architectures can be relatively easy to maintain and update. This is because all of the components of the application are in the same codebase, which makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.

## Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

    Maintainability: Monolithic architectures can become increasingly difficult to maintain as the application grows in size and complexity. This is because changes to one component of the application can have cascading effects on other components of the application.
    Scalability: Monolithic architectures can also become difficult to scale as the application grows in popularity. This is because all of the components of the application are tightly coupled, which can make it difficult to add new servers or distribute the workload across multiple servers.
    Deployment: Deployment of monolithic applications can be complex and time-consuming. This is because all of the components of the application need to be deployed together.

### Use Cases for Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic architectures are well-suited for small and medium-sized applications with relatively simple requirements. They ***can also be used for large and complex applications***, but this requires careful design and implementation.

Some examples of applications that use monolithic architectures include:

    E-commerce websites
    Content management systems
    Customer relationship management (CRM) systems
    Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
    Social media platforms

### Important Criteria- Reasons

Reasons:

    Simplicity: Monolithic architectures are the simplest to design and develop, as they do not require complex coordination between different components.
    Efficiency: Monolithic architectures can be very efficient, as all of the components of the application are co-located on the same server. This reduces latency and improves performance.
    Ease of maintenance: Monolithic architectures can be relatively easy to maintain and update, as all of the components of the application are in the same codebase.
    Cost: Monolithic architectures can be less expensive to develop and maintain than other types of architectures, such as microservices architectures.

Criteria:

    Small to medium-sized application: Monolithic architectures are well-suited for small to medium-sized applications, as they can provide good performance and ease of maintenance at a relatively low cost.
    Simple requirements: Monolithic architectures are also well-suited for applications with simple requirements, as they do not require complex coordination between different components.
    Limited resources: Monolithic architectures can be a good choice for organizations with limited resources, as they can be developed and maintained more easily than other types of architectures.

When to avoid monolithic architecture:

    Large and complex applications: Monolithic architectures can become difficult to maintain and scale as applications grow in size and complexity.
    Applications with high availability requirements: Monolithic architectures can be more vulnerable to outages than other types of architectures, as a single failure can impact the entire application.
    Applications with strict performance requirements: Monolithic architectures may not be able to meet the performance requirements of some applications, such as real-time applications.


### Conclusion

Monolithic architectures offer a number of advantages, including simplicity, efficiency, and ease of maintenance. However, they can also have a number of disadvantages, such as difficulty maintaining and scaling, as well as complex deployment.

When choosing an architecture for your application, it is important to carefully consider the specific requirements of your application and the trade-offs between different architectural patterns.
